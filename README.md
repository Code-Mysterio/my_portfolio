# Mobile Portfolio for Code_Mysterio

This project is my mobile app portfolio showcasing my skillset, and experience, and details recruiters might need to know about me.
For more details about me, you can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/abdulola001/).


## Getting Started with the App

Below would be a descriptive overview of the App, this overview would give you a sense of direction while navigating the app.


### Description of the App and its features.

I do not believe that every portfolio should come in the form of a website. As a mobile developer, it'll be a great feat to showcase my portfolio in the form of a mobile app, and that's what this project is all about.

I built this mobile app to showcase my skillset, experience, and expertise as a mobile developer.

If you're a recruiter or someone curious to see what there is in this project, here's a quick overview of what to expect; This app serves as my portfolio, also where you get to know about me in a few tour clicks of the app, feature details include;
- about myself
- my experience
- my skillset
- my educational background
- projects I've worked on, and
- link to my social handles in case you want to see more about me, or reach out for a project.

**Let's create magic together.**


### Description of the Codebase and how it works.
It's noteworthy to understand the codebase structure before diving. For this reason, I'll be doing a quick rundown of the code base structure. Important files and folders to take note of in this code base include:
- main.dart file
- screen folder
- custom widget folder
- image folder
- font folder
- pubspec.YAML file

It is also important to have a quick rundown of how these files and folders are structured to work and interact with one another.
A glance below:
- main.dart file - this file serves as the engine room of my app as this is where the app starts running when launched.
- screen folder - this folder contains all the code files for the app UI.
- custom widget folder - this folder contains some extracted widgets which are customized to be reusable across the app, also serves the purpose of reducing our lines of code while still maintaining quality across a file and easing navigation across the codebase in case there's a need for debugging when bugs or issues are encountered.
- image folder - this folder houses all the images/photos used in the app project.
- font folder -  a custom font was used as the default font of the app, this folder houses the different typefaces of the font family which can be used across the app.
- pubspec.YAML file - this is where custom assets such as images, font and libraries are declared for them to be usable in the app


### Description of the Design and how it works.

The design structure of this app was inspired by [Venge](https://dribbble.com/m6v3l9) [Portfolio Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15061439-Personal-Portfolio-Resume-CV-Mobile-Shots) on Dribble.
Venge did a satisfactory job with the design, which is straight to the point while also showcasing someone's skills and experience creatively.

How it works: The design flow is structured to go from the splash screen to the home view, and from the home view, you can choose to either navigate to the "about me" section, which tells more about me, or go to the "my work" section, which showcases my project.
I followed the same approach as Venge, so a recruiter or anyone viewing my portfolio finds it easy to navigate and interact with my app interface.


### Description of the Libraries used and why.
At this point in the app, libraries are not in use for the app. This section will be updated once any library is used in the app codebase.


### Description of features I'd like to add if I had more time.
If I had more time, features I'll like to include in the app include;
- A glance view at my social media profile when a visitor clicks on my handles on the app without visiting the social media platform.
- An in-app messaging option so visitors can send me messages directly from the app.
- Make the codebase responsive on the web and iOS platforms. As flutter support both platform, it'll be easier for recruiters to view my portfolio without installing the app on their device.


### Description of the challenges I faced and how I solved them.
It is inevitable to always come across challenges while building an app. For this app, I faced some challenges when building it, and those challenges include:
- Not knowing how to write in Markdown language.
- Running flutter build on my project to generate the .apk file


I was able to solve them as listed below:
- I checked the official documention and cheat sheet of Markdown language, and learnt how to write in Markdown.
- I check StackOverFlow but, that didn't help. I had to contact a friend that's also on the internship for help, and we were able to solve the bug together.
